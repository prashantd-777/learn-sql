-- Use {TableName} to refer to the table name in the SQL query. For example:
use MyDatabase;

-- Question: Find customers whose first name contains leading or trailing spaces.
SELECT
    first_name
FROM customers
WHERE first_name != TRIM(first_name);

-- Another solution
SELECT
    first_name,
    LEN(first_name) AS len_name,
    LEN(TRIM(first_name)) AS len_trim_name,
    LEN(first_name) - LEN(TRIM(first_name)) AS flag
FROM customers
WHERE LEN(first_name) != LEN(TRIM(first_name));
